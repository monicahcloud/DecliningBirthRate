# DecliningBirthRate
 Reproduction is important in order to achieve a balance of family life, diversity, socio-economic equality and progress across communities. 
 
 Currently declining birth and fertility rates in the United States are having a significant impact upon both the absolute and relative size of the child population. The magnitude of this impact extends to the practice of pediatrics. In order to coordinate with diverse communities to reduce health disparities and improve sexual health for our next generation, we  need to analyze births and fertility trends in the United States to find demographic information about the target market for planned parenthood/pediatric clinics in order to acquire and retain new customers.
